# Overview

This is a Python program that determines whether a user-inputted integer is even or odd. The program demonstrates input/output operations, conditional logic, error handling, and user-friendly interface design. It includes comprehensive error handling and allows multiple number checks in a single session.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Design
- **Single-file architecture**: The entire application consists of one Python file (`main.py`)
- **Function-based approach**: Uses functions for better code organization and reusability
- **Interactive console application**: Relies on standard input/output for user interaction
- **Loop-based execution**: Allows multiple number checks in a single session

## Input/Output Strategy
- **User input handling**: Uses Python's built-in `input()` function with robust `int()` conversion
- **Result presentation**: Employs f-strings for clear, formatted output
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for invalid inputs and unexpected errors
- **User experience**: Provides clear instructions and graceful exit options

## Logic Implementation
- **Modulo-based calculation**: Uses the `%` operator to determine remainder when dividing by 2
- **Conditional expression**: Implements ternary operator for concise even/odd determination
- **Exception handling**: Try-catch blocks for ValueError, KeyboardInterrupt, and general exceptions
- **Input validation**: Checks for exit commands and handles non-numeric inputs gracefully
- **Loop control**: While loop for continuous operation until user chooses to exit

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Dependencies
- **Python interpreter**: Requires Python 3.x runtime environment
- **Standard library only**: No external packages or libraries required

## System Requirements
- **Operating system**: Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Console/terminal access**: Requires command-line interface for user interaction
